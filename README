These directories contain plugins for supybot from three places.
Supybot-plugins-20060723 comes from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/supybot/.  edsu-plugins come from
plugins Ed Summers wrote for his supybot.  Simple "plugins" were
written locally, and consist of minor variations on the built-in
plugins, which can be found at
http://fruct.us/built-in_supybot-plugins/.

Anyone with write privileges to this repository should feel free to
edit any plugin, and any plugin from the built-in that you wish to
override should be created in the "plugins" directory.
